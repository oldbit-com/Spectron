# Spectral
Yet another ZX Spectrum emulator written in dotnet. It is a cross platform emulator that runs on Windows, Linux and MacOS.

Why another emulator? Because I wanted to do it and it has been a lot of fun. And a challenge as well, something
very different from what I do in my day job. And I love the ZX Spectrum, it was my first computer.

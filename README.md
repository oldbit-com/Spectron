# Spectron
My ZX Spectrum emulator written in C#. It is a cross platform emulator that runs on Windows, Linux and MacOS.

Why another emulator? Because I wanted to do it and it has been a lot of fun. And a challenge as well, something
very different from what I do in my day job. ZX Spectrum was my first computer and I loved it.

UI is written using excellent [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net) framework.

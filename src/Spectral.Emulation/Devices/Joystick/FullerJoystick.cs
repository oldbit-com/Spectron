    // This joystick port used port 7Fh, which returned F--RLDU, whose active bits were low
    // (0=triggered, 1=untriggered). It supported standard Atari-style joysticks just as with
    // the Kempston, Interface 2, and Cursor joystick interfaces. The Fuller interface is quite
    // a rare item these days as they didn't sell in great numbers.
